# mern-stack
A MERN stack boiler plate: MongoDB + Express + React + Node

This main setup comes from Brad Traversy. This is a slightly edited version with a boiler create-react app.
His design was to have it hosted on Heroku. Be sure to have your `.env` file with the proper variables need
(look into `config/` for the needed vars).
